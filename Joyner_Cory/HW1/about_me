My name is Cory Joyner and I am a second-semester, first year Biology master's student in Dr. Field's lab. As an undergraduate I was involved in a research project aimed at identifying new antimicrobial targets from isolated soil samples and it was through this project that I gained my first exposure to bioinformatics. We used sequencing to identify these bacterium and most of the work to prepare the raw data was completely new and very interesting to me. I knew early on I wanted to pursue something similar in graduate school! 

My initial research in the lab focuses on the role of horizontal gene transfer in shaping these iron-mat communities. Currently, I am analyzing sequencing data taken from an iron-mat that was contaminated with benzene from an underground oil leak. We are interested to see if the iron-reducing or iron-oxidizng bacteria (who naturally have genes that can break down benzene into co2 and acetyl-coa) share those genes with other members of the community to improve remediation efforts. Depending on how things go, we may expand to also looking at iron-mats from an evolutionary standpoint to determine the role of HGT. I am also interested in incorporating transduction analysis once I find the proper programs to analyze viral signals from metagenomic data! My thesis is, until further notice, completely computational.
